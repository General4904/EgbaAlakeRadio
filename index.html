			<h3>Before Oyo Empire:</h3>

			<!-- <figure id="olokun"><img src="images/ori_olokun.jpg" /><figcaption>Ori Olokun</figcaption></figure>-->
			<p>
				The history of the Yoruba people begins in Ile-Ife(Ife Empire). This
				kingdom was founded by the deity Oduduwa, who is believed to have
				created the world. Oduduwa was the first divine king of the Yoruba
				people. It is said the Yoruba people believe that their civilization
				began at Ile-Ife where the gods descended to earth. The Ethnic group
				became popular internationally due to their trading with the Portuguese
				which gave them guns for their trade. The Yoruba were invaded by the
				Fulani in the early 1800s, which pushed the people to the South. In the
				late 1800s, they formed a treaty with the British Empire and were
				colonized by Britain beginning in 1901. The people who lived in
				Yorubaland, at least by the seventh century BC, were not initially known
				as the Yoruba, although they shared a common ethnicity and language
				group. The historical Yoruba develop in situ, out of earlier
				(Mesolithic)Volta-Niger populations, by the 1st millennium BC.
				Archaeologically, the settlement at Ile-Ife can be dated to the 4th
				century BC, with urban structures appearing in the 8th-10th Centuries.
				"Between 700 and 900 A.D., the city began to develop as a major artistic
				center," And "by the 12thCentury Ife artists were creating bronze,
				stone, and terracotta sculptures." The phase of Ile-Ife before the rise
				of Oyo, 1100 - 1600, is sometimes described as a "golden age" of
				Ile-Ife.
